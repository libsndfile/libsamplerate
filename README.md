## Win32

There are detailed instructions for building libsamplerate on Win32 in the file [`docs/win32.md`](https://github.com/libsndfile/libsamplerate/tree/master/docs/win32.md).

## macOS

Building on macOS should be the same as building it on any other Unix platform.

## Other Platforms

To compile libsamplerate on platforms which have a Bourne compatible shell, an ANSI C compiler and a make utility should require no more that the following three commands:
```bash
./configure
make
make install
```

## CMake

There is a new [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/)-based build system available:
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

* Use `cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..` to make a release build.
* Use `cmake -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON ..` to build a shared library.
